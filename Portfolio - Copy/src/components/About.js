      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a computer science student with a strong passion for web development and software engineering.
        I love creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences through code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently pursuing my degree at [Your University], I've worked on several projects involving React,
        Node.js, and more. I enjoy learning new technologies and solving real-world problems.

        Apart from coding, I enjoy playing guitar, gaming, and watching sci-fi movies.
        I'm also an avid reader and always up for a good conversation about tech or creativity!
